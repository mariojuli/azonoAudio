Multimedia sound processing for hearing impaired listeners


azonoAudio is a VST-plugin with the aim to process music that hearing impaired listeners will hear more details and have an overall less listening effort. azonoAudio uses a multiband dynamic range compression which can be adjusted by the user in predefined schemes. The schemes were designed to cover various hearing losses and listening preferences. 

In conjuncten with 'EqualizerAPO' a system-wide real-time processing is possible. 
This means that all sounds played back are enhanced, independent of the software used.
Look in the provided 'Installation_Manual.pdf' to install 'EqualizerAPO' and set up azonoAudio for your system.
Please be aware that azonoAudio will reduce the volume of your system to avoid 'digital distortions'. Therefore, it's recommended to use azonoAudio with playback equipment that can provide sufficient amplification, e.g. headphone amplifier or HiFi speakers.

Hifi processing for hearing impaired listeners


azonoAudio is a VST-plugin with the aim to amplify details of music or speech so that hearing impaired listeners will benefit from it. azonoAudio uses a multiband dynamic range compression which can be adjusted by the user in predefined schemes. The schemes were designed to cover various hearing losses and listening preferences. 
The processing of azonoAudio will reduce the volume of your system to avoid 'digital distortions'.  Therefore, it's recommended to use azonoAudio with playback equipment that can provide sufficient amplification, e.g. headphone amplifier or HiFi stereo speakers.

In conjuncten with 'EqualizerAPO' a system-wide real-time processing is possible. 
Look in the provided 'Installation_Manual.pdf' to install 'EqualizerAPO' and set up azonoAudio for your system.

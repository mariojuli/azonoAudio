Multimedia sound processing for hearing impaired listeners


azonoAudio is a VST-plugin with the aim to process sounds in a way that hearing impaired listeners will hear more details and overall more clarity with existing HiFi equipment. 
The focus of this project is to enhance music, nevertheless user report in a overall less listening effort when watching movies or listening to speech.
azonoAudio uses a multiband dynamic range compression which can be adjusted by the user in predefined schemes. 
The schemes were designed to cover various hearing losses and listening preferences. 

In conjuncten with 'EqualizerAPO' a system-wide real-time processing is possible. 
This means that all sounds played back at your computer are enhanced, independent of the software used.
Look in the provided 'Installation_Manual.pdf' to install 'EqualizerAPO' and set up azonoAudio for your system.
Please be aware that azonoAudio will reduce the volume of your system to avoid distortions. 
Therefore, it's recommended to use azonoAudio with playback equipment that can provide sufficient amplification, e.g. headphone amplifier or HiFi speakers.

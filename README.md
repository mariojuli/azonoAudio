Multimedia sound processing for people with hearing impairment

## Project Description
Even though hearing aids offer advantages in most situations, hearing aid users often complain about a bad sound quality when listening to music via hearing aids.
A reason is that the processing of hearing aids might be accurate, but the bandwidth and sound quality is limited due to the size of the devices.
HiFi audio equipment on the other hand offers an excellent sound quality, but the sound is often described as muffled by hearing impaired listeners.
That is where azonoAudio comes into place. 
azonoAudio has the aim to process sounds in a way that hearing impaired listeners will hear more details and overall, more clarity with the existing HiFi equipment. 
The focus of this project is to enhance music, nevertheless user report in an overall less listening effort when watching movies or listening to speech. 
azonoAudio uses a multiband dynamic range compression which can be adjusted by the user in predefined schemes. 
The schemes were designed to cover various hearing losses and listening preferences.

In conjunction with the application EqualizerAPO, a system-wide real-time processing is possible. 
This means that all sounds played back at your computer are enhanced, independent of the application used. 
Once set up, EqualizerAPO with azonoAudio will run in the background of your computer and no further user inputs are necessary.

## Installation
Look in the provided installation manual to set up azonoAudio for your system and adjust it for your preferences.

Please be aware that azonoAudio will reduce the volume of your system to avoid distortions. Therefore, it is recommended to use azonoAudio with playback equipment that can provide enough amplification, e.g. by using a headphone amplifier or HiFi speakers.
